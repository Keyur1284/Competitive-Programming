Points to remember:
Step1. Identify a DP Problem.
Step2. To solve the problem after identification.
   1. Try to represent the given problem in terms of index.
   2. Do all possible operations on that index according to the problem statement.
   3. To count all possible ways - sum of all stuff.
        To find minimum/maximum - Take Minimum/maximum of all stuff.

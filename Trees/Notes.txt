Types of binary trees

Full Binary Tree

A full binary tree is a special type of binary tree 
in which every parent node/internal node has either two or no children.
A full binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which all nodes other than 
the leaves have two children. In other words, all internal nodes have two children 
and all leaves are at the same level.
A full binary tree is also known as a proper binary tree or a 2-tree.

Complete Binary Tree

A complete binary tree is a special type of binary tree in which every level, 
except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes are as far left as possible.
A complete binary tree is also known as a proper binary tree or a 2-tree.

Perfect Binary Tree

A perfect binary tree is a special type of full binary tree in which all internal
nodes have two children and all leaves are at the same level.
A perfect binary tree is also known as a full binary tree or a 2-tree.

Balanced Binary Tree

A binary tree is balanced if the height of the tree is O(Log n) where n is the number of nodes.
For a balanced tree, the time complexity of searching, insertion and deletion is O(Log n).

Degenerate Tree

A degenerate (or pathological) tree is a tree in which every internal node has one child.
Such trees are performance-wise same as linked list.


Binary Tree Representation

A binary tree can be represented in two ways:
1. Linked Representation
2. Array Representation

Linked Representation

In this representation, each node of the binary tree is represented by a 
separate object. Each node object contains three parts:
Data
Pointer to left child
Pointer to right child

Array Representation

In this representation, the binary tree is stored in an array. 
The root node is stored at index 0 of the array. For any ith node, i.e.,
 node whose value is stored at index i in the array, the left child is stored at index 2*i+1 
 and the right child is stored at index 2*i+2.

Binary Tree Traversal

Binary tree traversal is the process of visiting each node of the binary tree exactly once. 
There are three types of binary tree traversal:
Inorder Traversal
Preorder Traversal
Postorder Traversal

Inorder Traversal

In this traversal, the left subtree is visited first, then the root and later the right subtree.

Preorder Traversal

In this traversal, the root node is visited first, then the left subtree and later the right subtree.

Postorder Traversal

In this traversal, the left subtree is visited first, then the right subtree and later the root node.

Levelorder Traversal

In this traversal, the tree is traversed level by level from left to right.

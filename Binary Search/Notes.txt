Lec 2 Notes :-

Lower Bound function    (vec[index] >= num)
Array/Vector has to be sorted
Time complexity = O(log_2 n)

returns an iterator pointing to the first element which is not less than num.  
(which means can also be pointing to the num if found)

auto it = lower_bound (StartIterator, EndIterator, num);
int index = lower_bound (vec.begin(), vec.end(), num) - vec.begin();

Upper Bound function    (vec[index] > num)
Array/Vector has to be sorted
Time complexity = O(log_2 n)

returns an iterator pointing to the first element which is just greater than num. 

auto it = upper_bound (StartIterator, EndIterator, num) ;
int index = upper_bound (vec.begin(), vec.end(), num) - vec.begin();
